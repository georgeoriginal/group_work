# --- Explanation of FastAPI and WebSockets ---
# FastAPI:
# - FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
# - It is based on standard Python type hints and provides automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation.
# - FastAPI is asynchronous and built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, making it highly efficient and easy to use.

# WebSockets:
# - WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection.
# - Unlike HTTP, WebSockets allow real-time, bi-directional communication between the client and server.
# - They are commonly used for applications like chat systems, live notifications, and real-time data streaming.
